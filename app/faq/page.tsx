        {
          question: "What exactly do I get when I buy?",
          answer: `A standard UTF-8 CSV file with four columns — name, email, phone, and state — covering ${count}+ licensed real estate agents. It opens in Excel or Google Sheets and imports into any CRM or email tool without reformatting.`,
          link: { href: "/guides", label: "See import guides for popular tools" },
        },
        {
          question: "Where does the data come from?",
          answer: `Records are compiled from public sources including ${DATA_SOURCES.slice(0, -1).join(", ")}, and ${DATA_SOURCES[DATA_SOURCES.length - 1].toLowerCase()}.`,
          link: { href: "/data-sources", label: "Read the full data sources breakdown" },

        {
          question: "How fresh is the data?",

        },
        {
          question: "What share of records include phone numbers?",
          answer:
            "Email coverage is near-complete across the database, and roughly 40% of records include a direct phone number. Phone numbers are included at no extra charge — there's no separate 'phone append' fee.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do you have data for my specific state?",
          answer:
            "Yes — all 50 US states are covered, each available as an individual $49 state pack. Every state page shows the live agent count for that state before you buy.",

        },
        {
          question: "Does the data include brokerage names, license numbers, or production stats?",
          answer:
            "No. Records contain name, email, phone, and state. If you need production data or transaction analytics, an enterprise platform like CoStar serves that need — see our comparisons for an honest breakdown.",

          question: "I didn't receive my download email — what now?",
          answer: `Check your spam folder first — download emails occasionally land there. If it's not there within 15 minutes, contact ${SUPPORT_EMAIL} with your order email and we'll resend the link.`,

          answer:
            "Buy states individually at $49 if you target 1–3 markets. At 4+ states the $199 full database is cheaper than stacking packs — and it includes every state, so expansion later costs nothing.",

          question: "What's your refund policy?",

          question: "What does the data cost per contact?",
          answer: `The $199 full database includes ${count}+ contacts — a fraction of a cent per contact. Credit-based platforms commonly charge $0.10–0.50+ per revealed contact, which is why bulk vertical data is sold flat-rate.`,

          answer:
            "The records are business contact information for licensed professionals, compiled from public sources. Commercial email to them is governed by CAN-SPAM in the US: use accurate subject lines, identify your business with a physical address, and honor unsubscribes promptly. You're responsible for compliance as the sender.",
        },
        {
          question: "Can I use the data for multiple campaigns or clients?",
          answer:
            "Yes. Once purchased, the data is yours for your business use with no per-use restrictions — agencies routinely use it across client engagements. Reselling the raw data itself requires a separate licensing conversation.",

          question: "Which tools does the CSV work with?",

            "Anything that accepts CSV import: cold email platforms (Instantly, Smartlead, lemlist), email marketing tools (Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, Brevo), and CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce, GoHighLevel, Close). We publish step-by-step import guides with field mappings for each.",

          question: "How should I email a large list without hurting deliverability?",
          answer:
            "Never blast the full list from one inbox. Use warmed sending domains, keep per-inbox daily volume low, verify emails before big sends, and segment by state so copy stays relevant. Our import guides include per-tool deliverability tips.",

        },
        {
          question: "What does the Pro API include?",
          answer:

          answer:
            "Choose the CSV if you want the data inside your own tools (email platforms, CRMs, spreadsheets). Choose the Pro Dashboard if you prefer looking agents up in a web interface without managing files. The CSV is one-time; the dashboard is a subscription.",
