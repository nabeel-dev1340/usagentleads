              <h2 className="text-[22px] font-semibold text-ink mb-4">Why We Built This</h2>

                <p>
                  If you sell software, services, or products to real estate agents, you know how hard it is to
                  find accurate contact data. Most providers charge hundreds of dollars for outdated lists, require
                  expensive subscriptions, or deliver data full of duplicates and dead emails.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We built USAgentLeads to solve that problem. Our database of {displayCount}+ contacts is sourced
                  directly from official state licensing boards and public records, verified for accuracy, and
                  delivered instantly as clean, CRM-ready CSV files.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whether you need contacts for a single state or the entire country, our one-time pricing model
                  means you pay once and own the data. No subscriptions, no per-record fees, no surprises.
                </p>

              <div className="space-y-4 text-[15px] text-body leading-[1.8]">
                <p>
                  Every contact in our database originates from publicly available sources. We aggregate data from
                  state-level real estate licensing boards, commissions, and regulatory bodies across all 50 states.
                  These are the same records that any member of the public can request.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our data pipeline cleans, deduplicates, and standardizes this raw data into a consistent format:
                  full name, email address, phone number, and state. We run regular verification passes to maintain
                  deliverability rates above 90%.
