      "Every closed transaction ends with a move — and 'do you know a good mover?' is one of the most common questions agents get from clients. If your moving company isn't the one agents mention, a competitor is. Our database of licensed agent contacts lets you introduce your company to every agent in your service area and stay top-of-mind through the busy season.",

        question: "Why are agent referrals better than purchased moving leads?",
        answer:
          "Purchased leads are typically resold to multiple movers and arrive price-shopping. An agent referral arrives with trust already transferred — the client asked their agent for a recommendation. One good agent relationship can produce referrals for years.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I buy just the states we operate in?",
        answer:
          "Yes. State packs are $49 each, so a regional mover buys only its operating states. National carriers and franchises usually take the full 50-state database at $199.",
      },
      {
        question: "When should I run agent outreach campaigns?",
        answer:
          "Ahead of peak season — most moves happen in late spring and summer, so agents are deciding which movers to recommend in early spring. A second touch in fall catches the year-end relocation wave.",
